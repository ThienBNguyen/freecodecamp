		<h3 >Life's adventure of Larry Page</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Page was born on march,26, 1973 in East Lansing, Michigan.</li>
			<li>His father, Carl Victor Page, Sr., earned a PhD in computer science from the University of Michigan. Page's mother, Gloria, was an instructor in computer programming at Lyman Briggs College and at Michigan State University.</li>
			<li>
				Page was first attracted to computers when he was six years old. He became the "first kid in his elementary school to turn in an assignment from a word processor"
			</li>
			<li>
				Page attended the Okemos Montessori School in Okemos, Michigan, from 1975 to 1979, and graduated from East Lansing High School in 1991.
			</li>
			<li>
				 Page holds a Bachelor of Science in computer engineering from the University of Michigan, with honors and a Master of Science in computer science from Stanford University.
				 <ul>
				 	<li>created an inkjet printer made of Lego bricks</li>
				 	<li>replace its bus system with a PRT System which is essentially a driverless monorail with separate cars for every passenger.</li>
				 	<li>business plan for a company that would use software to build a music synthesizer during this time.</li>				
				 </ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				In 1998, Brin and Page incorporated Google, Inc. with the initial domain name of "Googol," derived from a number that consists of one followed by one hundred zeros—representing the vast amount of data that the search engine was intended to explore. 
			</li>
			<li>
				 In 1999, Page experimented with smaller servers so Google could fit more into each square meter of the third-party warehouses the company rented for their servers.
			</li>
			<li>
				By June 2000, Google had indexed one billion Internet URLs , making it the most comprehensive search engine on the Web at the time.
			</li>
			<li>
				During his first tenure as CEO, Page embarked on an attempt to fire all of Google's project managers in 2001. Page's plan involved all of Google's engineers reporting to a VP of engineering, who would then report directly to him—Page explained that he didn't like non-engineers supervising engineers due to their limited technical knowledge. Page even documented his management tenets for his team to use as a reference:
			</li>
			<li>
				January 2011 announcement, Page officially became the chief executive of Google on April 4, 2011, while Schmidt stepped down to become executive chairman. By this time, Google had over $180 billion market capitalization and more than 24,000 employees.
			</li>
			<li>
				in 2011 to 2013, Page's two key goals were the development of greater autonomy for the executives overseeing the most important divisions, and higher levels of collaboration, communication and unity among the teams
			</li>
			<li>
				At least 70 of Google's products, features and services were eventually shut down by March 2013, while the appearance and nature of the remaining ones were unified.
			</li>
			<li>
				In January 2013, Page participated in a rare interview with Wired, in which writer Steven Levy discussed Page's "10X" mentality—Google employees are expected to create products and services that are at least 10 times better than those of its competitors—in the introductory blurb. 
			</li>
			<li>
				In September 2013, Page launched the independent Calico initiative, a R&D project in the field of biotechnology. Google announced that Calico seeks to innovate and make improvements in the field of human health, and appointed Art Levinson, chairman of Apple's board and former CEO of Genentech, to be the new division's CEO.
			</li>
			<li>
				in a March 2014 TedX conference that was held in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The presentation was scripted by Page's chief PR executive Rachel Whetstone, and Google's CMO Lorraine Twohill, and a demonstration of an artificially intelligent computer program was displayed on a large screen.[
			</li>
			<li>
				On August 10, 2015, Page announced on Google's official blog that Google had restructured into a number of subsidiaries of a new holding company known as Alphabet Inc with Page becoming CEO of Alphabet Inc and Sundar Pichai assuming the position of CEO of Google Inc.
			</li>
			<li>
				In October 2015, Page was named number one in Forbes' "America's Most Popular Chief Executives", as voted by Google's employees. In August 2017, Page was awarded honorary citizenship of Agrigento, Italy.
